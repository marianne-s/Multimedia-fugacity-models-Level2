# Multimedia-fugacity-models-Level2
  Level 2 multimedia fugacity model for the Environmental Chemistry students and researchers </br>
With Level 2, we introduce **advection** and **reactions** of the chemicals: It grants the first estimate of environmental persistence, an important property of the overall fate of a chemical in the environment. The Level II model remains an evaluative model. By introducing loss processes Level II is more releasitic than Level I, but interphase equilibrium is still assumed. In a Level II model the chemical is emitted continously at a fixed rate E and reaches a steady- steady condition (with equilibrium between the phases) where input and output rates in the overall system are equal (see Figure below). It is irrelevant into which compartment the chemical is emitted, as it is instantaneously distributed throughout the whole system (due to the interphase equilibrium assumption).
